# Indium Chatbot
Indium Chatbot is an AI-powered assistant that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about Indium’s services. It leverages semantic search and generative models to return intelligent, context-aware responses from a curated knowledge base.

## Features
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
- Semantic document search using Sentence Transformers.
- Vector similarity matching with FAISS.
- Language generation using Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., Mistral-7B).
- FastAPI-powered REST API for backend processing.
- Chat-ready frontend with real-time interaction.

## Usage
### All required libraries can be installed using a single-line command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### While to run the code:
#### Local FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### On browser:
Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
